# Facets of Geometry & other notes.

1. [Facets of Geometry](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/TheFoG.pdf). This is my $\LaTeX$ notebook made over the years (Under construction!).
2. [Singular Spaces](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/SingSpaces.pdf). Notes on intersection homology and perverse sheaves.
3. [Strongly Local Constructions](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/SLConstr.pdf). A small criterion for when a construction on rings can be glued. Generalizes normalization of an integral scheme and reducing a scheme to its reduced scheme.
4. [Riemann Surfaces](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/RiemSurf.pdf). Notes on seminar series on Riemann surfaces (Under construction!).
5. [Nine Weeks of Groups, Fields \& Galois theory](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/GrpFieGalProblems.pdf). My solutions to weekly assignment problems on fields & Galois theory for the course taken during Jan-May, 2024 at ISI Bangalore.
6. [Sheaves & Topos Theory](https://whendustsettles.github.io/Notes-FoG/Sheaves%20%26%20Toposes.pdf). Summer project report on sheaves & topos theory. Includes basic discussion on topoi and sheaves together with categorical logic. Includes the proof of independence of CH with AC.
